# Harry-Potter-Library-Web-Application
This responsive web application was a University project developed by me using PHP, HTML and CSS along with using an SQL database to store some sample data - It was designed to be a library system for users to be able to create an account, search books (by name, genre or author) and view account details (including loaned out books).
